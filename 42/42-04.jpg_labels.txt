85,39,But I should get a girl\, right? <Sigh> I feel mother-in-law tricked me...
286,53,She had 2 daughters\, and my mom too! Yaga\, y\nou are creating history!
437,76,Haha... let's stop talking and eat! Can't make the daughter hungry...\n
64,229,Well\, nobody has brought up the fact I was leaving tomorrow\, but that's good... we get to avoid awkwardness...\n
284,191,Ceberus\, keep coming back and help babysit!\n
421,186,Cheers\, hope you hurry up and become a High Wizard!\n
242,406,[Ceberus thinking] \nA Master Wizard\, like Teacher and Curse... can I really do it? He has more confidence than me in myself. It's time to see the wide world\, but it is so wide\, where first? \n\nYaga said\, Tesler and Teacher both traveled everywhere when they were young\, so I should go too... why do I have a nagging feeling he is just chasing me out?\n
63,551,Don't worry\, Yaga is not chasing you away!\n\n[Ed: Syd with dat telepathy]
139,667,Wha\, what? I wasn't... Pft\, what are you talking about?
232,522,Rainbow City's construction is stablized\, Teacher is also focusing on himself and not the castle. You're free and no longer needed to help the Teacher with the dirty things. For Yaga\, this means a lot. He always feels like he owes you. Rainbow City owes you.\n\nTake your freedom and explore\, just don't bite people!\n
