109,89,This woman... she's a monster! Before she was just eccentric\, but she's totally a monster now!\n
243,91,Fuck\, why am I asking her?\n
329,31,Where do you think I should go?\n
450,47,For people like you who have no sense of position in society nor ideas\, going to Sidar as a mercenary is best. I can give you a ride\, and throw you down once we get there.\n
210,199,I can't believe I accepted. How embarassing... but this balloon shit is quite good. The gnomes are bad at magic\, but surprisingly skilled at their tech.\n
427,225,Feels so nice to fly\, with the world under your feet\, as if you're a god...\n
202,369,Sometimes I'm really impressed with Syd. In the whole school only she learned Mathematese. Even Parker only knows a little bit\, but she was able to enter the gnomes' academy... still don't know what she's learning from those weird guys though...\n
432,344,... and now she has enough pull to help design the Gnome's new city! This is much cooler than being some wizard working for royalty.\n
77,516,We hire Sidar mercs too. Below is Sidar\, see you later!\n
108,607,Hmmph.\n
306,552,Syd... Professor Syd! Something isn't right!\n
382,541,Your friend is going down\, but... vertically! He's just going straight down!\n
19,688,Don't worry\, captain. He's a very strong wizard. The skies are nothing to him.... wait!\n
341,690,What if... he hasn't learned how to fly yet...\n
383,676,This prideful idiot!
