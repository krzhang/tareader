670,164,Before the Elves entered the tallest mountain -- Girard\, under the mountains already lived generations of Gnomes. Gomes have no sense of territory or ownership. Their only interest in Elves came from their ability to fly -- the Elves's proud Eagle Riders were Tarsylia's strongest force in the skies and the best defensive force of the mountain. Of course\, the Gnomes were not interested in any of this\, just the flight...\n
677,314,First\, they studied Eagle husbandary\, but this research direction was quickly rejected. The Elves saw the eagle riding as something holy... some of these were not normal eagles but gods -- descendents of the white Eagle Lufismel. It took 80 years to train a single eagle rider... Gnomes didn't fear time\, but they knew they wouldn't get those eggs.\n
670,380,Thus\, they started to use engineering. This started easy\, small Gnomish airships quickly formed and were able to fly at low altitudes. But then the Gnomish scientists realized that to raise the ships above 1000 meters over sea level\, they needed higher energy sources. With the help of Dwarven engineers and Dwarven ore\, gear-based generators were born... a few scientific revolutions later\, the Gnomish ships achieved 2000 meters. After seeing these ships circling beneath them\, the Elves got scared and their chieftains met. With "the Gnomish mechanical advances are threats to all of Tarsylia; we must stop their dangerous proliferation"\, the eagle riders destroyed the ships\, and outposts started appearing on the mountain\, vigilant!\n
666,541,Of course\, Gnomes did not care for wars of revenge. The aggression of the Evles\, to them\, was analogous to bad weather -- just small obstacles in the path of research -- they focused on the maxmimum height and the ability to escape the range of the watchposts. In 40 years\, the Gnomish ships were able to fly where even the eagles could not reach. They sang and danced above the holy mountain\, and got "revenge" on the Elves through pure joy...\n
664,664,Nobody knows what they are interested in now or researching what. Searching is the entirity of their life. Such pure joy\, living for their dreams... as for humans\, their dreams are always twisted by their desires and fame. They are fragile and greedy\, always worried about how other people would think... at the end\, dreams become their biggest source of self-torture...\n
130,848,Toro\, did you know? My outfit is the first piece of clothing I made...\n
341,853,I was really happy\, but my father said: "Why are you making this? The Weavers wouldn't accept you?"\n
585,849,Let's make a new outfit for you\, Toro! Like those Gnomes! ... Hehe...\n
