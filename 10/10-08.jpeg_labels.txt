645,33,A great alchemist fell in love with the king's daughter. He vowed to get her\, and he used his alchemy to prove his worth to the king one step at a time. He created many wonders of the world\, and the whole kingdom thought he was like a god. Finally\, he married that girl.\n
644,111,After marriage\, for his wife's heart\, he did whatever he could to make her happy. He became a mermaid to dive for pearls; he became an eagle to get flowers from cliffs; he became a horse to let her ride him into the mountains; he became a tiger to fight monsters for her; he even became a harp under the moonlight to play the music of the heavens for her... every day was fresh and magical\, and the princess started warming up to him\, and happiness was just ahead...\n
642,195,After one year\, he was woken up by a shrill cry\, and he say the princess poining to him\, asking "help!" The guards and butlers ran in\, all startled. "What's going on?" The alchemist said\, and walked in front of the mirror\, and was himself struck with fear... the himself in the mirror was now a hideous monster. He knows all his body-changing medicines had side effects\, but he never knew it would be so terrible. He had no time\, for the guards have already started drawing their swords. The princiess screamed: "Kill that monster! He must have eaten my husband!"\n
647,316,Full of wounds\, he ran back to his tower\, where his teacher was...\n\nHis teacher said: "I can help you. I have medicine for you to recover your body. As long as you drink it\, and imagine your original body\, you'll turn back."\n\nThe alchemist said: "This is so easy. Thanks for giving me this chance to undo everything..."\n
610,419,But after drinking the medicine\, he realized he forgot what he used to look like. Looking in the mirror\, he mumbled: "This isn't me\, isn't me! But where is the old me?"\n
608,478,From then on\, he lived in the royal forest. When the night is deep and nobody is out\, he would look into the distance with a pained expression...\n
