655,17,A long time ago\, there was a demon. He caught many kids and locked them into his cave\, corrupting them with magic\, mutating them until they become demons too. Of course\, to mutate completely requires a lot from the kids... if not good enough\, they'll be eaten...\n
664,60,One of the kids is called Yaya. He's middling in talent\, and did not care about the magic power the demon promised\, so the demon wanted to eat him. But Yaya said "I am unqualified to become like you\, but I can cook for you! I'm really good at cooking." The demon agreed\, and his stomach was conquered by Yaya's cooking. The demon thought: "once I get sick of his food\, I can eat hhim!" But then Yaya was able to make different delicious food every day\, and the demon really didn't want to kill him...\n
665,184,After 20 years\, the demon finally died in the hands of some of the kids who have grown into demons\, and Yaya obtained his freedom... those demons were impatient to fly out into their own journeys. When saying goodbye\, they asked Yaya: "The demon died. What are you going to do?"\n\nYaya said: "Find a rich guy\, be his cook."\n
663,274,The demons laughted: "if you are hard working like us\, you wouldn't end up in this position! Look at us\, using our magic we can do whatever we want\, be a king\, a warlord\, be gods among men\, get any item we desire... sadly\, you won't be able to share this happiness with us!"\n
663,325,Yaya smiled: "Happiness is being able to be yourself. Farewell\, friends!"\n
