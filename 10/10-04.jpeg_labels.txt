663,31,It was a prince from a tiny kingdom. When he was born\, the court astrologist said that the weather was special\, and the Prince will be someone special as well. The King\, the Queen\, and all the people waited with anticipation.\n
672,176,The Prince grew up slowly under all the attention\, but the King found out that he was uninterested in horses\, swords\, military strategy... he also doesn't have a head for commerce\, nor an ear for music or poetry. At 18\, he couldn't even remember all the Court procession rules. The astrologer lost his head... the only thing special was that the Prince loved animals\, and even the animals in the royal forest liked to approach him. The people started joking: "the Prince is special... a special stable boy!"\n
681,351,At 20\, the Prince still didn't change. The King got tired of this and asked the Prince to get married in the next kingdom. With many animals\, the prince arrived there in one month. The princess there was beautiful\, and the prince fell in love immediately! However\, the princess did not want to marry this idiot-looking price from a small kingdom\, who had no attitude\, no ambition\, and is surrounded by a bunch of livestock! She yelled "My days! How can I marry a failure? Am I to spend my life with a bunch of animals? Get out!"\n
41,464,The Prince\, filled with pain\, left the Palace with too much shame to return to his home country. He wept by himself in the forest. At this point\, a druid appeared in front of him: "Child? Your tears are drowning my trees. What is making you so sad?"\n\nThe prince: "I'm a failure that disappoints everyone. I have no talent\, and nobody loves me except for these animals..."\n\nThe Druid: "To be loved by animals... what a talent! Child\, the world is so wide\, there will always be someone who needs you -- this is the law of nature. I'm old\, and I've waited for a protector of these forests for many years... I think you'd be a good fit. Do you want to learn under me?"\n\nPrince: "Of course!"\n
30,683,And so the Prince followed the Druid to the depth of the forest... after many years ago\, this failure became Tarsylia's highest-ranked Druid.\n
