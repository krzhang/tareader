31,37,When you're sad\, you hope that this is a nightmare and you can wake up to perfection. When you're happy\, you fear that this is a dream and you can wake up to nothing... Toro\, it seems I've always lived in a fairy tale... I always think this way!\n\nIf... you want to... we don't have to end this story!\n
27,95,Haha... no\, Toro... I remember your story about Yaya: before Yaya died\, his demon friends came to his side from all over to see him off. One of his best friends said angrily: "Why? Why is your life so short? This is unfair! Let's use magic and help you escape this fate!"\n\nYaya mildly said: "Using time to measure life? That's sad..." Yaya is my favorite character from all of your stories.\n\nNo\, this isn't the same\, this...\n
33,198,It's the same\, Toro. It's all stories\, except the scenes and the characters are different. Nobody knows if they're in a story or outside. Everyone is looking for their own endings. I always asked myself when I was young: why didn't I have a single exciting story? No prince to rescue me from a dungeon\, no gods or priestesses\, no treasures\, why is my life like this? I now finally know\, the story of life... is not just so other people can listen... \n\nfamily\, love\, dreams... everyone has these in their lives\, but what's the best ending? Compared to foolishly comparing this and that\, I rather just try to remember moments of happiness.\n\n... mm...\n
35,327,Toro\, do you have other stories for me? I'm getting sleepy...\n\nNo\, nothing... the story is over. The girl\, she... lived happily ever after...\n\nHow beautiful!\n\nYeah. Have a peaceful night.\n
