661,43,There was a child studying magic\, who was very curious. He was unable to accept that there are secrets. Nobody can hide things from him\, especially the old wizard... he thinks\, the Old Wizard must be holding things from him so he doesn't surpass him. That's why\, every time he sees the old Wizard do something abnormal\, he will sneak into the Wizard's secret room...\n
644,112,It's not easy to get into the room! First you have to not be caught by the imps\, then you have to avoid the traps\, and finally you have to unlock the curses on the door. If you are careless\, the Old Wizard will catch you. Luckily\, this child was clever and hasn't been caught yet...\n
667,177,One day\, the old Wizard came back from some abyss or hell... he didn't talk to his students at all and went into the room with a metallic face... the kid thought: "there's a secret here! I must find out what it is!" That day\, the room was much more protected than others\, with extra curses that seemed like they were warnings\, but that only inspired the kid to work harder... in 3 more hours\, he snuck in\, and saw that the old wizard was in the room setting up a very complicated magical field\, with a crystal vase in the center... something is growing from the vase slowly\, with the help of the old Wizard. Behind the shelves the child waited\, breathless\, but he suddenly saw a black entity sprouting from the vase\, as if it had eyes that were looking at him. He heard the old wizard's curse\, the field collapsed\, and a black mass flew ay him...\n
641,315,After a few days he awakened from a stupor. The old wizard looked at him with a terrible visage\, saying coldly:\n\n"This is your own fault\, little idiot. Do you know that? One of the most pitiful type of people in the world is the kind that things everything has an answer and that they'd be able to find it! Anyway... this Cursed Bramble sustains itself with your soulr. Every time you get emotional it will grow physically. It will become a part of your soul and even Death will not do you two apart... I hope you are satisfied with this answer\, my curious student!"\n
193,856,This is too much! Fine\, I won't go...\n
423,892,Telling me such a scary story!\n
