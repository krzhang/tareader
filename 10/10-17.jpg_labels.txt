39,11,In the islands far far away to the north\, a nest of birds sprang out of their shells in the spring. The sun was warm\, the wind was gentle... the birds cheeped and chirped and jumped among the trees\, chasing\, playfighting. At night\, the parents come back to the nests with fish and share it. Every day was happiness. In a blink\, the birds need to learn to fly. Then realized that one bird was different... its wings never grew; it can't fly! They called him "Crawl-crawl".\n
26,123,Crawl-crawl didn't realize it was different when it was young\, though it did now. It tried to be happy\, to be accepting\, to forget\, to smile... so what\, it couldn't fly? As long as everyone was happy together? But\, winter was coming\, and the birds need to go to the islands to the south. I guess it needed to stay and die\, it's only natural... everyone flew away\, and the northern winds started to howl...\n
29,232,Crawl-crawl finally understood. Compromise can't change anything. It was just a joke since birth. In the cold winds\, it cursed this world\, its gods\, everything related to it... death was coming...\n\nbut God came before Death. God appeared and said: "I heard your grief. I want you to know\, God will help you. I'll lend you a pair of wings\, let you fly to the island. However\, there's a condition: with these wings\, you can't talk to anyone or make friends. You must face the world alone. Else\, the wings will leave your body. That's right\, these wings are named "Solitude". Bye!\n
29,365,Using these wings\, Crawl-crawl flew to the south\, through a long\, solitary\, painful journey. It kept saying to itself "this is life." After a few months it arrived at the island\, it saw friends\, smelled nostalgia\, bathed in light... and God reappeared: "Good\, child. You get it now? God does not leave anyone behind. Now\, give me my wings back\, and go back to your friends!"\n\nCrawl-crawl was filled with anger: "you want to take my only friend away? You monster! Why don't you kill me?"\n
671,470,God also got angry: "You are not thankful\, and... Fine! Then keep it forever! I hope this life fulfills you!"\n\nCrawl-crawl said nothing\, it flapped its wings and flew in the direction of the ocean\, without turning back... it does not know what stood ahead\, it does not know when it will run out of strength. It only knows: \n\n"Life\, is a sisyphean fortitude. You cannot select fate\, but you can select honor."\n
672,691,Like so\, it flew and flew and flew and flew... flew and flew and flew... it didn't wait for anyone... nobody would wait for it...\n\nThe story did not finish\, but it has an ending:\n\nThe bird died\, happily...\n\nHehehehe...\n
