350,63,A long time ago\, in the northern mountains was a wizard known to be cruel. His castle is close to the old Kaspar kingdom. They say he has a daughter as beautiful as a goddess\, and every morning she plays the harp on the top of the tower. Every youth who passes by can't help it but pause\, listening to the moving music\, looking at the beautiful image.\n
248,201,Quickly\, the number of youths who came to court or even just to look at the girl ballooned. However\, the tyranically wizard left many tests\, and turned anyone who failed them into stone... they stood at the sides of the road...\n
392,320,This news quickly passed to the ears of the prince of the empire. This knight hated evil; he came alone\, declaring war upon the wizard... however\, that morning\, under the ramparts\, he heard the most beautiful harp in the world... it was so elegant\, as if it would penetrate his body to heal his soul... the prince was mesmerized by this girl\, and laid down under the castle for 6 days. He read poetry\, he sang\, he danced\, the girl's face showed a blush\, but she held her silence...\n
45,487,The prince couldn't take it anymore. He rushed into the castle\, but the wizard appeared! He summoned demons and other minions to kill the prince; fire\, lightning\, and blood shot everywhere. The wizard yelled: "your impulsiveness will be met with death!" The prince replied: "you have no right to imprison a free person\, even if it were your daughter! You also have no right to stop my love for her. If you persist\, I'll destroy you!"\n
254,603,Finally\, the prince's sword entered the breast of the wizard...\n"Why are you doing this? Don't you want her to be happy?"\n"Why? Then what do you love about her? Same reasons..."\n"I love her beauty and purity... I love her kindness and reservation..."\n"Beauty is because time was not able to leave its mark on her; purity is because she has not experienced the evils of the world; kindness is because she has not experienced difficulty; reservation... reservation... is because my daughter is mute..."\n

587,852,Just say it's a small gesture of gratitude...\n
