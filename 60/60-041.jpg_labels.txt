102,19,Perfect bait!\n
256,16,Bottom of The Abyss\n
303,136,The seed you gave that warrior finally grew into a tree! You saw through his untamable quality\, you know one day he'll break out of his dreams. It's time to harvest\, Enil\, with interest! You got back your strength and half of mine. Even though it was a "fair bet"\, you used this god-countering technique against your own! Apologies for my lack of ettiquete\, as only you and I remain in the Abyss and we cannot avoid conflict. But now the balance has been broken\, congrats\, the new Master of the Abyss!\n
253,346,An ephemeral anger means this transaction was not completely fair\, Fnashai. This is an insult for both of us!\n
128,541,Why are you giving me all your strength?\n
407,444,As long as we are here\, we cannot escape the constraints of "fate." Then our â€œOrigin Theories" will never exceed those of the dead! It is time for a change\, accept my apologies!\n 
349,492,A hundred tactics for one action\, the dream is about to come true. With my strength and meditations\, your empty dreams can be realized. A new Abyss will be constructed by you!\n
166,698,The only thing I keep is your ablity to jump between souls. I no longer need you to go to the physical realm!\n
