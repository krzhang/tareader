31,52,These are regular... let's call them "Standard." They move on fixed tracks...\n
459,80,They are there to block the irregular shapes from moving to the "empty" space\, which might end up forming some picture...\n
106,233,So\, we need to understand what the target picture is!\n
244,260,I mentally moved all the Standard tiles... they all have a set track... I must do an optimization on these track orderings\, so I don't get a deadlock that traps any of the irregular shaps...\n
145,425,It looks like the irregular tiles are the key\, but...\n
240,348,Don't be sad if you can't understand her!\n
242,428,This ground is weird?\n
387,436,Parker\, I think every wall is a system. If we understand all the tracks\, we can derive the answer...\n
98,503,Don't overthink it. Four walls. There's fire. Then what we have left are wind\, water\, earth.\n
320,543,What? The elements?\n
447,546,Look\, as you said\, there's only a few irregular ones. Looking at the fire... we should get water.\n
437,669,As for the other two... the Wind one seems identical. You take Earth!\n
