74,70,Huhuhu.... so fucking hot... Parker\, why did your "windmill" stop so quickly... huhu...\n
346,23,Ugh\, why is it still not working? I already made 7 kinds of giants...\n
457,99,Of course. I am successful here\, just one lion short. (cough cough: why are you torturing him?)\n
127,237,(to weaken him\, so if he loses control we can still keep him in control. Even now I have not figured out the disruption mechanics of the Puzzle Wall. But if only he feels hot\, it might be a psychological type...\n)\n
273,246,I forgot about that! But if we're fast\, it wouldn't be an issue.\n
452,246,Hey\, apparently it works now! Do you need my help with the kitten? Hehe fine\, it looks like you don't need it.\n
239,385,The temple builders should have learned how to draw. This Titan is ugly like hell!\n
459,396,Not right. Huhu.. why is it so easy? This must be a trap. Maybe the walls are not what's important?\n
159,541,What... what are you saying? Are we not done after the second layer?\n
209,512,Why does this temple exist?\n
478,555,Why does this floor contain spirits that help us? I don't believe it's just for our good!\n
71,700,Easy? Really? Fine\, I hope the third layer wouldn't be too hard. Done!\n
283,653,Ye! You feel it too? It's not over!\n
453,647,I derived it based on the difficulty scaling!\n
