502,51,I want to rip your throat apart! I am thirsty!\n
88,273,I don't want to hurt him\, and all magic will run out quickly! I'm almost out...\n

432,224,Ceberus\, you must pin him\, so we can solve the puzzle!\n
46,384,Let me go\, don't be his dog! Let's be wolves. Let's eat him!\n
272,335,Did you not hear them? If you go crazy now\, you'll die from weakness!\n
