116,540,I remember now. No need to feel pain\, because it's just a part of the cycle. What an Emperor must experience. He must lose to understand gain. He must feel small to be appreciative. After the destruction\, everything returns. My Kingdom\, my family\, my love will all return to me.\n\nBut\, I really want to stab this demon once! I know it's infinitely strong\, I know I can't win\, but... I just want one stab! Even if my sword breaks!\n
