390,63,Maybe you think as an Emperor I have nothing to do. Hehe... putting a correct person in the correct place is my most important job.\n\nI'm very busy every day\, busy with my beautiful and gentle queen Iweil and my 3 kids. Without the title of Emperor\, as a mature man\, you need to understand how to deeply appreciate a woman's transformation through time constantly running out. The love you can get is finite\, which is not capped by how many people love you\, but how much love you can give. Accompanying kids as they grow up is the most important task for the Emperor\, because that's the Empire's future. The Prince has no brothers. Two lovely sisters will not affect his positioning\, just his responsibility.\n
