183,153,An Emperor who thinks himself great\, with only a small kingdom... I can choose to conquer other worlds and satisfy my pride\, create my legacy\, but... would I be happy? The answer is "no"! I like the way it is\, because I understand appreciation. An Emperor with no understanding of appreciation has no right to be where he is.\n
