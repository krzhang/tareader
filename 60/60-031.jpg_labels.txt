54,59,This urge is so strong\, I am unable to sleep! Oh\, I can sleep again? Is this the dreamland I yearn for?\n\nThe maw of the demon slowly open\, its stink coming straight for my nose\, it icily screams: "You! Do you remember my Name? Uu... do you remember..."\n\ngrrr...\n\nI sleep. Just waiting for everything to come back. The Emperor ascends his throne. When I wake\, I'll forget this nightmare... but I just fell asleep?\n\nGrrrr....\n\nI want to pierce its throat!\n
