50,30,War can unite the people\, let all the groups forget their differences. However\, the moment peace warms up\, internal strike starts again! Luckily\, my Head Priest Kubo has sufficient control... the churches everywhere are like my clones\, managing all the forces... however\, to let them be fully obedient\, I need the financial head Ceylont to control people with the invisible hand... this is not easy\, but as long as we are using the right people\, the Emperor can proceed with no fears!\n
