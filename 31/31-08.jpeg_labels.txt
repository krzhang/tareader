64,61,Oh the two exotic animals got here somehow? Haha\, Ceberus took everyone's attention.
220,47,Heles\, use your eyes to see their conditions?
424,37,Nothing special. Cerberus is angry\, chaotic breathing and fast heartbeats. Aimedahl... same thing\, that kind of breathing and heartbeat... he's up to something.
69,190,But honestly... I have lost all faith in my ability to read him. He has shown the same vital signs in all situations...
294,179,As for Parker... sigh... it's like a prince about to enter a ball\, hehehe...
271,257,Bardo\, I've decided. Let's bet all our money on Ceberus!
74,346,Wait... Cerberus's casting is already amateurish\, even though he works so hard\, every test he gets nervous... in this condition...
304,352,You're the one that gets nervous. Ceberus is indeed emotional in other tests\, but think about it\, has he performed abnormally in any contest so far in **this** test?
407,341,Where the hell did you come from? Did you be on Ce\nberus too?
504,346,Sorry\, I never gamble.\n
70,539,That's right... he has not yet lost his cool in this test. But also\, his half of the brackets have no dangerous people. If he were in our half...
328,498,If he were in this half\, then right now this is the semifinal. Don't underestimate him. He has the \nskills.
422,530,In the last 16\, besides Bardo\, everyone can reconfigure weapons from the elements. Cerberus's limit is 2 short fire daggers\, but our bracket's Kif can make 5 wind scimitars.
300,682,Maybe if Bardo and I meet him we wouldn't be able to win. But at his level\, he can't beat those fuckers in the Upper School. Without defense like Bardo's\, he might even die against Kif!
449,666,I think the opposite... I bet that to keep his life\, Kif would resign like Yarweh\, especially if he saw that same flame axe.
