82,520,I now know why you wanted Parker to wear robe... your other top student is literally playing with his life...\n
299,505,That's not a top student\, just a dog that doesn't know how to let go... also\, Parker found your robe by yourself. I didn't interfere...\n
445,522,I remember when Parker started wearing that when he turned 16! I even guarded it with a Ward of Confusion...\n
158,661,But he opened it the night he got the box. No offense to your skills...\n
204,656,... as long as you tell Parker there's a gift for him in a box\, even if it were Aladon's Grave\, he would open it!\n
