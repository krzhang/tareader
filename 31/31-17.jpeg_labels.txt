112,121,Then why not just summon a fire demon?\n
262,72,If you want to make one that's more than a flaming puppet... there has not been a successful case in history that have realistic abilities and attacks. Think about it; you need the anatomy and the behavioral instincts to match\, and construct it from purely elemental energy... this is a piece of art. Understand?\n
98,236,Am an an idiot? How come I've never seen this? Teachers never said it\, books never talked about it...\n
289,218,The time has changed... after the wizards learned about Summoning Contracts from Druids\, we have lost this magic. Too hard. Now people basically only use summoning\, because you get the real deal to show up directly... that's why nobody teaches this. However\, in the rules of this contest...\n
335,352,Look at this fire wolf. It's like an actual living being... believe me Mein\, nothing that appeared so far is anything like it. He doesn't need to do it so perfectly either\, though his casting methods are... unbeautiful.\n
516,374,Beautiful! But Exaros\, is this scholastic? Classical education? Don't let him waste his time... your specialty is Summoning magic right?
524,510,Just tell him how to summon a Hell Hound directly... it's so much easier? Who does this anymore?\n
128,689,Besides fire\, he doesn't understand anything else... he is not able to even learn Summoning! In fact\, basically\, not able to learn much magic at all...\n
214,710,That's all he has\, Guinile. That's also the only thing he can depend on...\n
465,676,It's like a big joke... poor kid!\n
