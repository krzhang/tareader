61,44,So you're saying.. he wasn't that strong? If I didn't hesitate and pushed forward... I could have beaten those Upper School guys... could have beaten Kif...
288,43,ARRGH
471,49,There's a winning probability\, but not very high. It is still harder to make such a weird weapon than a normal one\, which is a signal for his true strength. But it is easier than making two weapons."
87,185,Wow... you reopened Bardo's wounds. I'm going to get some medicine... Sid... please don't agitate him more!
257,197,Sid... are you saing Ceberus could actually have the strength of an Upper ? This is too...
432,210,Of course not\, but I think this test is basically made for him. Especially that one-minute prep time... it destroys other students' advantages against him.
88,345,Even though he is better at using fire than others\, but the other differences don't change?
277,350,Do you remember yesterday? Parker and Kif both did nothing in that one minute\, and only started when the Safe phase ended!
398,355,Haha\, Kif's battle of honor\, almost like a duel...
309,497,... and before his fart even started blowing\, Parker's wind scythe was at his back.
226,581,Embarassing. I'm impressed he's even here today.
475,501,Kif's speed and Aimedahl are similar... anyway in a real fight\, Ceberus would have no time to use his strongest moves! This aspect will be invariant.
145,643,What made me interested is... his other improvements -- even when he is notably agitated\, his movements show no loss of control (though still limited to fire magic).
256,643,Means this dog was born to kill and burn.
455,646,Rationally\, he cannot beat Parker. But\, if he uses that one minute... and if that strange outfit is what I think it is...
