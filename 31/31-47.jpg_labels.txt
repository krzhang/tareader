87,38,Another failed trip across the sea...\n
225,46,Think about it. You can move the whole tower here.\n
386,15,The situation there is too complicated. As for letting me run the academy... if someone is running a coup\, or starting a massacre\, maybe people like me or Marklov would be useful... this is how Curse rejected you too\, right?\n
124,253,Didn't even dare... he seems really far from humanity\, in body and mind... I ran away!\n
259,241,No matter what\, he will be aloof. That also means he won't hurt a guest.\n
384,210,Sorry\, we always talk about "Friends"\, "friends\," and when we need to I can't even help a single bit! Sorry\, it's more like I'm too scared...\n
98,361,I learned there that the Marklov family disappeared en masse\, becoming sacrifices! If so\, then his magic\, and his students... they'll all be boosted by demons and contracts\, with destruction way beyond that mad dog of yours... you sure you won't want to come?\n
477,337,You're not a friend. At most a fellow from my past. His strength is above me\, but it's not easy to kill a wolf in his nest!\n
108,574,But you are not a beast. You're a teacher... so you have a lot of concerns\, but Marklov doesn't!\n
251,542,Among beastmen\, only the most skilled can be Trainers! It was the highest glory! Wahahahaa!\n
390,544,You'll soon meet\, it seems. When needed I can come pick up Parker. Do you not want David to help?\n
71,738,I put a guy on your boat; he can help you. With him\, your academy will definitely succeed!\n
341,722,Who? Besides you two\, our people won't recognize anyone...\n
482,653,Rick James\, one of the three Master Wizards... your folk must have heard of him! He ran into some problems and I'm holding him... he can escape to over there!\n
