131,21,As I got older\, I realized he was right... it was obscenely hard to make another step. But what I want to say is...\n
152,192,Hahaha...\n
402,11,One day we matched up against another batch of wizards. One of the "geniuses" wanted to humiliate me\, and used a high level Mirror Mirage\, and walked in front of me\, saying "give me the best you got!". My teacher always said the moment wizards lose their cool\, they already lost half the battle\, but I was just a Beastman... most importantly\, I use Mirror Shadows all the time\, but that genius didn't realize he was standing on sand\, and... mirages don't make footsteps!\n\nAs he requested\, I used my best skill\, which was Bonebreaking... I thought Teacher would be happy that I beat a high-level wizard\, but he cut off our relationship.\n\nThen I traveled with Brother myself. You can't imagine how many wizards were crushed by my hands\, many of them "geniuses"... haha\, I remembered what I wanted to say!\n
54,378,You know the 3 main Master Wizards\, right? Me\, James\, and Curse Marklov... James is an encyclopedia\, but he doesn't know magic! Marklov... he's my teacher. Actually when I was young there were many wizards with Aimedahl's talent\, way above me. And my distance with Teacher in magic is... a bit shorter than between yours and Parker.\n
475,377,But so what? They're dead! Dead people have no use for talent!\n\nHave you thought about it? What a joke to have "Genius" as epitaph on your tombstone?\n
261,501,During the exam\, if Yaga went for Parker's throat\, and you bit Aimedahl's throat... what use is their talent? Your gaps in magic might be unbridgable\, but if you live longer than them\, you might be able to pass them. If you kill everyone stronger than you\, then you're the genius\, the greatest wizard. "Genius" is just... this.\n
455,490,Curse can't kill me\, since I learned survival from the Beastmen. This is my talent\, and yours!\n
131,652,It's tough to find your positive points just to make you feel better... but you know what you need\, right?\n\n
318,660,I think you knew ever since the first day we met! Use it. It will let you remember your path.\n
391,648,Your attitude is explosive\, insecure\, temperamental\, you don't care about others' feelings\, you won't have many friends\, you'll be lonely\, the medicines you use will scare away any woman...\n
