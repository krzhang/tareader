320,39,Beautiful... worthy of Parker!\n
456,56,Yeah. If that dog can do it\, why can't those 2 demons do it?\n
122,386,Syd\, does this fucking count as "demon"?\n
296,385,Can't argue with that... though it's Parker and Aimedahl's "demon." It's gaudy but practical. The difficulty is not as high as that wolf\, but...\n
449,402,This seems to counter Ceberus. Did they already know Ceberus's play?\n
132,529,Why does it counter them\, Heles?\n
461,490,Those 2 are geniuses\, but they haven't spent this time on elementalism... perfect harmony. This is an imperfect "vulture\," it's really just 2 wind scythes; it doesn't even really have a lower body\, though its technically the wind wrapping around the casters as protection\, and that body... wow.\n
89,648,Didn't Syd say only similar level elemental beasts can beat that wolf?\n
292,692,I calculated the rules as being good for Ceberus\, but this...\n
481,695,The attack power is lower than that of the wolf\, or the precision of its movement\, but its effective range is exactly the difference between the two teams!\n
