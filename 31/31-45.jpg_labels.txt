294,79,Aimedahl\, Parker\, and Yaga\, very soon\, with charisma\, talent\, and wisdom\, would gather amazing resources! Henchmen\, allies\, fanatics... they're all resources. They'll have their families\, love\, glory\, fame... none of these are for you! Knowing what you won't get is a talent as well! This will you you be more pure\, more committed\, distractionless.

495,37,Other people can't do this! Don't let these things waste your energy. Friends\, love\, family...\n
45,332,If they can be exchanged for power\, don't hesitate\, sacrifice them! Only with power can you live the way you want to live. Before that\, loneliness is your fate\, demon is your nickname\, lowly is your path!\n

230,519,When you should die\, die. Before that... live with whatever method you can. Don't worry about what other people say. Your path is different from them\, and you can only see Hell along the way. Remember\, only the weak will waste time to chase other people's love and respect.\n
494,499,For a man\, I respect you. If a man has the courage to fight\, then he's not weak!\n
136,670,So I'll give you some privileges. It's not just about the Inner Class...\n
443,654,From today on\, learn whatever magic you want. As for those magic you can't even scratch the surface... I won't press you. If you can't learn them\, fine. Might as well focus on lighting your fire. \n\nThis is actually like Marklov... I don't like it!\n
