243,50,I think this is weird too. Teacher is really practical\, but why would he make this artificial contest? It has no real combat value..."

57,213,Losing is losing. That rabid dog made me a ton of money! Hehe...
256,209,If so\, would you keep betting on him this round?
479,197,You must be joking boss! Did you forget that I'm all about these angle shots!?
58,334,Of course not!"
282,363,Let's do a special one. The loser drinks this 'Kiss of the Obscene Demon'. Accept?
411,339,Of course! [formally]

71,503,Sorry Sid. If I didn't screw up my support that other day...
309,495,No problem. There was a high probability of unexpected failures when I teamed up with you... I was prepared.
427,509,Exciting day... all the people we can think of are here!"
487,656,Hey look up there! The four top guys in Upper School are all here!
