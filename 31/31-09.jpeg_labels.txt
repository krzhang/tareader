117,28,Resign? For what? Bardo and I fought against him. I definitely know about the wind blades more than you! Don't underestimate us!
305,39,I like your tactics. You cleverly use Bardo's strength and the dirt walls to overpower stronger students than you. However\, you got afraid!
423,33,Sid... Bardo might be less good at elemental magic\, but he has never backed down. We want to beat Kif more than anyone. You should apologize!"
366,181,I know you wanted to go for it\, but you were clearly affected by the five swords. You didn't push forward. You froze for a bit\, then your actions seemed unnatural...
139,381,Even though you then pushed forward\, you lost your opportunity. Your distraction caused your dirt wall to weaken as well...
294,334,Originally you had 30% chance to win!
443,364,Sigh... what's past is past. Even the hardest dirt wall can't defend against the five scimitars...
129,508,Then how come yesterday\, Kif had to resign against Parker's single wind scythe?
236,534,Yeah\, why? Also\, where did our 30% come from? Sid\, you know I'm not very smart... tell me...
502,513,Elementary. Cerberus's two daggers are really "two" daggers\, but Kif's five scimitars are actually just "one!
207,649,Kif just made a single weapon with 5 blades\, and he hid the connectors between the blades. Wind weapons already look very wispy\, so it looks like there were 5/6 pieces around. It actually has no real advantage over a single piece...
451,679,To be honest\, if he wasn't showing off so much\, I myself would not have seen through it! I really don't understand why he did all this\, thinking he could scare Parker?
