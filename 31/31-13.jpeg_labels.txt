303,48,Looks like I'll try this too! Else\, my Academy is really going to just turn into a library. My head hurts right now...\n
466,79,Don't be silly. The Church is too strong where you are. Even with your royal blood and support of the King\, you're... just not a hard person.
40,234,Your boy is definitely a hard person.\n
498,181,Hey\, shouldn't you stop this? That kid already lost control... my birthday present might not be able to hold it...
68,529,That's his default situation. Nothing special. If Parker is in danger\, he can resign. Why should we interfere?\n

94,681,As we thought\, he's going for it in the beginning! When the sand runs out it will be instantly decided. But what weapon is he going to come up with this time?\n
285,685,Judging from his energy input\, stronger than that axe... the skin thing he is wearing is holding a lot of heat for him. Looks like Parker will have a hot time\, heheh...\n
448,689,I guess it was worth it for us to pave the road for this fight... I just don't want Parker to give up too early...\n
