446,580,What is Parker making? I feel he hadn't shown us his strongest yet. Ceberus's green skin is glowing too\, hehe...\n

297,699,Is that skin lowering his body temperature then? Good thinking. But if Ceberus already told Yaga his limit...\n
480,705,... then he isn't Ceberus. I fear that in his head is one thing: "Win\, or Die." As for his body's limits... well...\n
