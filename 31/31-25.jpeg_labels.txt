176,17,This will be the straw to crush his last bit of confidence. I want it to be a complete win. I want the straw to be like a cannibal's Club.\n
346,42,This is very cruel... but... why don't we just let him win? (he gets triple points too) Aren't you the one who wants him to join us in the Inner Class?\n
514,9,Cruel? To let him burn himself out \nlike fireworks time after time\, chasing us from far away? That's the most cruel!
143,248,Come\, more strategy! If we consider all options\, we can destroy him!\n
296,170,No need\, if I just put my wind scythe on the vulture\, that should be enough...\n
527,189,This is not enough. Please take this seriously. We are facing an extremely serious Ceberus!\n
166,345,Then just fight him! Yaga's support magic is nowhere near yours. My half wind-vulture versus some fire dog... nothing to be afraid of\n
348,391,Ow I forgot! You are an "all out" person too I guess...\n
520,364,"All out?" You act like you know what this means? Huh? I'm warning you!\n
169,519,You crazy\, Aimedahl? It hurts!\n
330,523,You want to use your "all out" against a real guy who's all-out every day? I'm afraid when the time comes\, you won't even know how you died!\n
528,514,<exhales>... usually you do whatever and I don't care. This time\, you MUST listen to me. Just this time!\n
153,650,I... fine... I got it! I won't sleep then...\n
316,681,Yes... can't sleep tonight. We have to actually work together...\n
469,669,Ceberus\, give up...\n
